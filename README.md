# TopKTestsS21

Test cases for TopK implementations, Spring 2021

This repository collects test cases for the Problem Set 3 "TopK" data structure implementations.  Files provided initially:

* TopK.java is the interface definition.
* TopKJDTRefSol.class is the compiled Java byte code for a reference solution implementation of the TopK interface.
* TopKTester.java gives an example of a test case.

Test cases should construct instances of TopKJDTRefSol.  This would be replaced with the actual class name of implementations when these are used for testing those implementations.
